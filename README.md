# Flight Finder
With the maintenance of a Google Sheet of cities you wish to visit and flight prices you're willing to pay, the app will send you an SMS if there are any flights within the next six
months which fit your criteria, allowing you to sign up for the flight.

## Current Work
Currently I'm just trying to get the program up and running.

### Future Work
Along with setting various search-criteria, the hope is to get a GUI search bar up and running with settings in a separate tab and the functionality through the Sheety API customizable
within those settings.
